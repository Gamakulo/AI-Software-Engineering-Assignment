This task automated login testing using Selenium WebDriver, simulating both valid and invalid credential scenarios. The AI-assisted tool reduced manual effort by automatically identifying input fields, executing test steps, and validating responses within seconds. The valid login confirmed successful authentication, while the invalid test detected incorrect credentials and displayed an error message. Screenshots of both outcomes were captured for verification.
AI enhances test coverage by executing repetitive test cases faster and more consistently than manual testers. It also detects interface changes, reduces human error, and provides continuous testing during code updates. With AI integration, test scripts adapt to dynamic elements, improving accuracy and maintenance efficiency. Compared to manual testing, AI-driven automation enables faster regression testing, early bug detection, and reliable validation, ensuring higher software quality with less developer supervision.
